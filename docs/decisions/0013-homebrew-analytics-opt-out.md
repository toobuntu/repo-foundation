# Disable Homebrew analytics in agent and CI contexts

## Context and Problem Statement

Homebrew sends usage analytics over the network on essentially every invocation. Agent and CI tooling shells out to `brew` repeatedly — toolchain probes in pre-commit hooks, and lint/test targets that run tools via `brew` — so each commit and lint run triggers analytics traffic. Inside the Claude Code agent sandbox this also surfaced as a recurring `curl (56) 404` against the Homebrew packages API for a pre-release macOS the API does not yet recognize (e.g. `dunno_tahoe`), polluting otherwise-clean lint output. This traffic is automated and non-representative: the same probe fires on every commit, the kind of usage Homebrew's own guidance asks CI to exclude.

## Considered Options

- Disable analytics for agent/CI `brew` calls (`HOMEBREW_NO_ANALYTICS=1` in the Claude Code session `env`).
- Allowlist the Homebrew analytics endpoint and leave analytics enabled.
- Do nothing.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **disable analytics for agent/CI `brew` calls**, via `HOMEBREW_NO_ANALYTICS=1` in the `env` key of `.claude/settings.json`. A Claude Code `env` applies only to processes the agent spawns, not the maintainer's interactive login shell — so it suppresses exactly the repetitive automated traffic while leaving normal interactive `brew` usage untouched, and it needs no telemetry host in the sandbox network allowlist.

(The separate packages-API 404 is handled where it occurs: `HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_FROM_API=1` scoped to a toolchain probe in the pre-commit hook, in repos that run one; `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE` does not cover that fetch.)

### Consequences

- Good, because Homebrew's analytics keep reflecting representative human usage; the agent's automated traffic is excluded, which improves rather than degrades their dataset.
- Good, because no telemetry endpoint is added to the sandbox network allowlist.
- Good, because the maintainer still contributes analytics through ordinary interactive `brew` usage.
- Bad, because the agent's `brew` usage no longer contributes any analytics — accepted, since that traffic is non-representative and unwanted by Homebrew.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Allowlist the analytics endpoint and leave analytics on

Add Homebrew's InfluxDB host, `eu-central-1-1.aws.cloud2.influxdata.com` (defined as `INFLUX_HOST` in `Library/Homebrew/utils/analytics.rb`), to `sandbox.network.allowedDomains`.

- Good, because the agent's `brew` usage would then contribute to Homebrew analytics.
- Bad, because it opens sandbox egress to a telemetry endpoint and feeds non-representative automated traffic into Homebrew's dataset.
- Neutral: this remains the path to take if contributing the agent's usage is ever explicitly wanted — unset the env var and add the host.

### Do nothing

- Bad, because it leaves the recurring 404 noise and per-commit telemetry, and the agent's automated runs keep skewing Homebrew analytics.
