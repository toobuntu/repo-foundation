# Use reuse lint-file with --no-multiprocessing in the pre-commit hook

## Context and Problem Statement

REUSE 3.0 compliance is enforced at two layers: the pre-commit hook in `.githooks/pre-commit` and the CI job `lint-reuse`. The CI job walks the whole tree. The hook needs a faster, scoped check that runs on every local commit attempt.

Two subcommands are available for the hook:

- `reuse lint` — walks the entire working tree. Slow on a clean clone, redundant with CI, and produces noise for unstaged files (in-flight WIP elsewhere in the tree, partial commits via `git commit -p`).
- `reuse lint-file <paths>` — added in reuse-tool 5.x specifically for pre-commit-style use. Checks only the listed files.

Independent of the subcommand choice, reuse-tool launches a `ProcessPoolExecutor` by default. This was historically benign but became a runtime failure on macOS under Apple's Seatbelt sandbox: Python's pool setup calls `os.sysconf("SC_SEM_NSEMS_MAX")`, which Seatbelt blocks at the syscall level with "Operation not permitted".

## Decision Drivers

- Local commits must not stall on tree-walks the CI already covers.
- Hook output must reflect only what's about to land, not in-flight work elsewhere in the working tree.
- The hook must not fail with sandbox-related errors when a developer runs `git commit` from a sandboxed shell or editor integration.
- Multiprocessing overhead should be quantitatively justified, not defaulted to.

## Considered Options

### Subcommand

- `reuse lint` — full tree walk
- `reuse lint-file <staged paths>` — scoped to staged set

### Concurrency

- Default (`ProcessPoolExecutor`, multiprocessing on)
- `--no-multiprocessing` (serial execution)

## Decision Outcome

The hook runs `reuse --no-multiprocessing lint-file <staged ACM paths>`.

CI's `lint-reuse` job continues to run the full-repo lint over the whole working tree. The two layers are complementary, not redundant: the hook catches issues at the contributor's keyboard on the about-to-land set; CI catches anything the hook missed (including contributors who bypass the hook with `--no-verify`) and provides the authoritative gate on the whole repo.

Because `lint-file` is scoped to staged paths, it is *not* a full-repo compliance check. The local equivalent of CI's whole-tree gate is `reuse lint` over the working tree (wrapped by a `make lint` target where a repo provides one), alongside the other repo-wide checks.

## Consequences

- Good, because `--no-multiprocessing` lets the hook run under macOS Seatbelt, where the default process pool aborts on a blocked `SC_SEM_NSEMS_MAX` syscall before any linting happens.
- Good, because serial execution beats spawning a pool for the ≤ ~20 files typical of one commit — a win on Linux too, not just a sandbox workaround.
- Good, because `lint-file` scopes the check to staged paths, so the hook reports only what is about to land.
- Bad, because `lint-file` is not a whole-tree check; the full-repo REUSE gates are only CI's `lint-reuse` job and `reuse lint` locally.
- Bad, because the hook needs the `REUSE_LINT_SKIP` test seam for the Unicode specs — a disable switch on a compliance check is a hazard if it ever leaks into real use.

## More Information

### Failure reporting

The hook lints twice: a `--quiet` detection pass, then — only on failure — a verbose re-run so the contributor sees the full report before the hook bails. The verbose re-run is a bare pipeline that exits non-zero by definition (it runs only when the detection pass already failed). Under `set -e` that non-zero exit terminated the hook on the spot, before the `scripts/annotate.sh` hint and the explicit `exit 1` could run — the commit was rejected with the report on stdout but an empty stderr and no remediation guidance. Appending `|| true` to the verbose re-run keeps `set -e` from preempting the hint. The path is pinned by `spec/integration/precommit_reuse_spec.rb`, which drives it with a stub `reuse` so no real install is required.

### Test seam

`REUSE_LINT_SKIP=1` skips the REUSE block entirely. Used by `spec/integration/precommit_unicode_spec.rb` so the Unicode scanner can be tested in a throwaway repo without a `LICENSES/` directory. This is an internal test seam, intentionally not documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. The REUSE block keeps its own coverage: CI's `lint-reuse` job (whole repo) and `spec/integration/precommit_reuse_spec.rb` (the hook's failure path).

### REUSE.toml caveat

A repo may annotate with individual SPDX headers and `.license` sidecars, or with a top-level `REUSE.toml`. `lint-file` *does* honor `REUSE.toml` declarations: a directory-level `REUSE.toml` covers its globbed paths and `lint-file` passes them without a `LICENSES/` directory present (verified locally; this is also why a per-throwaway `REUSE.toml` was considered, and rejected, as the test-isolation mechanism). A repo adopting `REUSE.toml`-based annotations should confirm the behavior still matches the full `reuse lint` path before relying on it.

### Sandbox

`--no-multiprocessing` makes the hook work under macOS Seatbelt. This is the failure mode reported in
[fsfe/reuse-tool#280](https://github.com/fsfe/reuse-tool/issues/280)
and
[openai/codex#2486](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/2486).
Without the flag, sandboxed commits fail with an `os.sysconf("SC_SEM_NSEMS_MAX")` permission error before any actual linting happens.
