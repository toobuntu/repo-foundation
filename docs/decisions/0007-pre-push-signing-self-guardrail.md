# Pre-push signing gate is a maintainer self-guardrail, not a contribution gate

## Context and Problem Statement

The `.githooks/pre-push` hook validates commit signatures before a push. As it evolved — and through a round of bot code review — its *purpose* was repeatedly mis-stated, by both an AI assistant and review bots, as if it enforced an integrity property of the repository or of its remotes. That framing produced a sequence of wrong "fixes": validate the entire history on a raw-URL push; scope grandfathering per-remote ("this-target" vs "published-anywhere"); exempt commits authored by other people. None of those serve the actual policy.

This ADR records what the gate is *for*, so future changes — and this hook's role as the org-wide canonical version in repo-foundation — are measured against the intended policy rather than re-derived from the mechanics.

## Decision Drivers

- Signing must not become a barrier to contribution (CONTRIBUTING.md, "Signed pushes").
- A commit's identity fields (author, committer) are trivially forgeable and cannot be the basis of any security decision.
- The hook is shared across repos and is canonical in repo-foundation; its intent must be documented, not just its code.

## Considered Options

- **Maintainer self-guardrail** — the gate exists so a maintainer who has signing configured does not *accidentally* push commits they forgot to sign.
- **Repository/remote integrity invariant** — enforce that the repo, or each remote, contains only signed commits.
- **Contribution gate** — require every committer to sign.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen: **the gate is a maintainer self-guardrail.** Concretely, as implemented in `.githooks/pre-push`:

- **Scoped by local signing config.** Enforce (reject) only when signing is configured locally (`commit.gpgsign=true` or `user.signingkey` set), or when `hooks.requireSignedPush=true` forces it. Otherwise the same scan runs but only **warns** and the push proceeds — a contributor who enabled the hooks for the pre-commit checks is informed, never blocked. `git config hooks.requireSignedPush true|false` overrides detection either way; a one-off bypass that keeps every other check is `git -c hooks.requireSignedPush=false push …` (preferred over `--no-verify`, which skips the hook entirely).
- **Validates the whole introduced range, regardless of author or committer.** The range is `remote_oid..local_oid`, or `--not --remotes[=<dest>]` for a new ref / unfetched tip — what the push *adds*, never the full history, so already-published commits (including pre-policy ones) are not re-flagged. Within that range every commit must carry an accepted signature. Author and committer are **not** used to exempt commits: both are forgeable (`git commit --author=…` / `GIT_COMMITTER_*`), so an identity-based exemption would be a hole. Maintainer-scoping is achieved entirely by the enforce-vs-warn split above, plus the fact that a maintainer re-signs whatever they push (an `--amend`/rebase records them as committer; the author is preserved).
- **`%G?` acceptance:** `G`/`U`/`X`/`Y` pass (a good signature was made); `N`/`B`/`R`/`E` are rejected.
- **No signing check in CI.** A signature check that *rejects* would gate contributions, contradicting the policy; CI therefore does not check signatures. Any server-side requirement on `main` is a GitHub ruleset, configured to match this policy — separate from CI, and applying regardless of local hooks.
- **GitHub web-flow merges.** These originate on the remote, so on a normal push they sit behind `remote_oid` and are never validated. In the rare case one is in the introduced range and unverifiable (`E`, because GitHub's public key is absent), the hook recognizes the web-flow committer (`GitHub <noreply@github.com>`) and points at the one-time import (`curl -fsSL https://github.com/web-flow.gpg | gpg --import`; an untrusted import is sufficient — it makes the signature *verifiable* as `U`/`Y` without extending trust). This is a **hint, not an exemption**: the gate still rejects until the commit verifies, so no security decision rests on the forgeable committer field.

Because the gate is local-only and concerns just "what am I, the configured signer, about to push," **the number of remotes is irrelevant** — the `--remotes` machinery exists only to identify newly-introduced commits, not to assert anything about remote state.

### Consequences

- Good, because contributors are never blocked; the policy is the maintainers' own.
- Good, because no security decision rests on a forgeable identity field.
- Good, because nothing about remote topology or CI is load-bearing, so the gate stays simple and the multi-remote question does not arise.
- Bad (accepted), because a maintainer must re-sign commits they push but did not author (e.g., taking a contributor's unsigned work forward by rebase). This is the intended flow — the signature is the committer's attestation; authorship is preserved.
- Bad (accepted), because re-signing unpushed commits rewrites their SHAs (the signature lives in the commit object). Safe while unpushed; the gate itself keeps an un-re-signed batch from reaching the remote.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Repository/remote integrity invariant

Treating the gate as "the repo / each remote contains only signed commits."

- Bad, because it isn't true and was never the goal — pre-policy unsigned commits exist and are grandfathered, and contributors' unsigned commits are allowed.
- Bad, because it invented a "multi-remote scoping" question (grandfather per-target vs per-any-remote) with no bearing on a local self-guardrail.
- Bad, because it motivated "validate the entire history on a raw-URL push," which re-flags grandfathered legacy commits for no benefit.

### Contribution gate (every committer must sign)

- Bad, because it directly violates CONTRIBUTING.md — signing is a maintainer policy, not a barrier to contributing.
- This is why enforcement is scoped to locally-configured signing, and why CI must not reject on signatures.

### Author/committer-based exemption

Exempting commits whose author/committer is "someone else."

- Bad, because the author field is set with `git commit --author=…` and the committer via `GIT_COMMITTER_*`; either can be forged to carry an unsigned commit past the gate. The gate therefore validates the whole range and lets enforce-vs-warn plus re-signing do the scoping.

## More Information

- CONTRIBUTING.md, "Signed pushes (maintainer policy, not a contribution gate)".
- `.githooks/pre-push` — the implementation; the canonical version across the org's repos.
- `docs/agent-principles.md`, "Agent commit + signing procedure under sandbox isolation" — the re-sign incantation and why SHAs change.
- This hook is canonical in repo-foundation; consumers' `pre-push` hooks are synced from it (ADR 0003).
