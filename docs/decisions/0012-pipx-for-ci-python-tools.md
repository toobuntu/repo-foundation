# Use pipx to install Python CLI tools in CI

## Context and Problem Statement

GitHub Actions workflows occasionally need Python CLI tools (e.g., `reuse`). Three installation mechanisms are available on `ubuntu-latest` runners: apt-get, Homebrew, and pipx. Plus `pip` itself, which is a fourth option with its own issues. Each has tradeoffs; the cheapest tool that satisfies the requirements should win.

## Decision Drivers

- PyPI freshness — apt-get packages for Python tools lag significantly behind PyPI releases.
- Overhead proportional to scope — installing one Python CLI shouldn't require Homebrew tap setup, PATH initialization, and reusable-action caching.
- PEP 668 compliance — Python 3.12 on ubuntu-24.04 is externally managed; pip 23+ refuses installs without `--break-system-packages`. The runner image papers over this with a `break-system-packages = true` entry in `/etc/pip.conf`, but the image source labels this a "temporary workaround" ([`install-python.sh` L15-21][install-python]) whose longevity cannot be relied upon.
- Environment isolation — system-wide pip installs can cause conflicts between concurrently-installed Python packages.

## Considered Options

- **apt-get** — system package manager. Stale PyPI versions.
- **Homebrew via `Homebrew/actions/setup-homebrew`** — requires PATH initialization via the reusable action plus, for repeat workflow runs, `Homebrew/actions/cache-homebrew-prefix` for binary caching. Appropriate when multiple non-Python tools are being installed together (as in `copilot-setup-steps.yml`), but disproportionate for a single Python CLI.
- **Homebrew via absolute path** — pre-installed Linuxbrew lives at `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/` on `ubuntu-latest` runners, but its `bin/` is not on PATH by default. The lightweight pattern: one `run:` step prepending the directory to `PATH` via `$GITHUB_PATH` (`echo /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin >> "$GITHUB_PATH"` — the idiomatic GitHub Actions form for adding a system path; a `PATH=…:$PATH` line to `$GITHUB_ENV` also works but is non-conventional), followed by one or more `run:` steps invoking `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew install <pkg>` directly. (toobuntu/homebrew-babble's `.github/workflows/tests.yml` is the reference; it currently uses the `$GITHUB_ENV` form and should be switched to `$GITHUB_PATH`.) No setup action, no cache action, no full `brew shellenv` eval. Adds two steps minimum (PATH echo plus install), but the PATH echo is one-time-per-job and amortizes across any number of brew-installed tools.
- **pip direct install** — blocked by PEP 668; bypass via `--break-system-packages` works today but the runner image's papering-over of this is explicitly labeled a temporary workaround. Also no environment isolation.
- **pipx** — pre-installed on `ubuntu-latest` with `PIPX_BIN_DIR=/opt/pipx_bin` and `PIPX_HOME=/opt/pipx`, both persistently set via `set_etc_environment_variable` in [`etc-environment.sh` L44-66][etc-environment]. `/opt/pipx_bin` is prepended to PATH in the same script. Each `pipx install` gets its own isolated virtualenv; the binary lands on PATH without any manual configuration — no `pipx ensurepath`, no `actions/setup-python`, no `Homebrew/actions/setup-homebrew`.

## Decision Outcome

The choice is contextual; both pipx and Homebrew-via-absolute-path are acceptable, and the right one depends on what else the workflow is doing:

- **pipx** when the workflow installs only Python CLI tool(s) and does not otherwise use Homebrew. One step (`pipx install <pkg>`) with the binary immediately on PATH. Zero setup overhead.
- **Homebrew via absolute path** when the workflow already installs non-Python tools via Homebrew (shellcheck, shfmt, ksh93, etc., as in toobuntu/homebrew-babble's `tests.yml`). The PATH-append step is already there, and adding `reuse` to the existing `brew install` line is essentially free.
- **`Homebrew/actions/setup-homebrew`** (the full reusable-action setup) is appropriate only when the workflow needs Homebrew-specific behavior the absolute-path pattern doesn't provide: tap installation, developer-mode env vars, prefix caching across runs, or interaction with the `Homebrew/actions/cache-homebrew-prefix` action.

Do not cache single small packages in pipx: the install time does not justify the added workflow complexity.

### Consequences

- Good, because the rule is workflow-shape-driven, not package-source-driven. Workflows that need only Python tools stay minimal; workflows that already use Homebrew consolidate cleanly.
- Good, because PyPI versions are used directly (via pipx) or current Homebrew bottles (via absolute-path brew), both avoiding apt-get staleness.
- Good, because both options install isolated, no-cross-tool-conflict package surfaces.
- Neutral, because the workflow author has to pick between two valid patterns. The decision tree is simple ("does the workflow already use brew?") but it is a decision.
- Neutral, because the `Homebrew/actions/setup-homebrew` action remains the right choice for the cases it's actually built for (taps, caching, developer-mode env). Not deprecated by this ADR; just scoped narrowly.
- Bad, because the absolute-path pattern hardcodes the Linuxbrew prefix `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/`. If a future runner image moves the install, every workflow using this pattern breaks. Mitigation: the prefix is documented in the runner-image source and changes are announced; risk is low but non-zero.
