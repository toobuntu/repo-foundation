# Agent operating principles

This file is committed to the repository so every contributor — human or AI — has access to it. It is imported into `AGENTS.md` (the file Claude Code reads automatically on every session) via the `@docs/agent-principles.md` directive near the top of `AGENTS.md`. Project-specific context lives in `AGENTS.md`; this file is the cross-cutting rules.

It is intentionally narrow in scope: rules that should apply to **any** agent working on **any** project. Project-specific rules (architecture, build commands, conventions) live in `AGENTS.md`.

## Pre-action discipline

Before any action that mutates the working tree, the index, branches, files, or external state — including `git stash`, `git switch`, `git restore`, `git commit`, `git rm`, `git worktree`, any `make` target that installs / mounts / writes outside the repo, `bundle install`, `gem install`, `npm install`, `pip install`, running project scripts that mutate state, file edits, daemon preference writes, anything calling `launchctl`, anything that runs `sudo` — state:

1. The exact command intended.
2. The expected post-state in a sentence.
3. The recovery path if it goes wrong.
4. Whether the operation is reversible. If irreversible, halt and ask.

Then wait for explicit approval before running. The permission prompts in `.claude/settings.json` are a backstop, not the primary review mechanism — they don't show post-state or recovery.

This costs ~20 seconds per state-changing turn. The cost is intentional. Sessions that try to compress it produce mistakes.

## Read before write

Before editing a file, read it. Before testing a script that mutates the repo, ask whether a worktree is appropriate. Before installing gems or other dependencies, check for project-local config that governs install location (`.bundle/config`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.). Before disabling a sandbox or escalating permissions, check whether the request can be satisfied from inside the sandbox by adjusting approach.

## Engineering principles

These software-engineering principles apply to any code or configuration the agent writes, edits, or proposes. They are not Claude-Code-specific; they describe what good code looks like. The list mixes always-applicable principles (DRY, YAGNI, KISS, idiomatic patterns, comments-minimum) with context-dependent ones (SRP, fail-fast, make-illegal-states-unrepresentable). The agent applies each one with judgment about whether it fits the situation.

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).** When the same logic, value, or configuration appears in multiple places, that is duplication and should be factored out unless there is a specific reason to keep duplicates (different evolution paths, different audiences, shipped-vs-derived). The principle is a tendency, not a rigid rule — three trivial similar lines are often clearer than one abstracted three-place call.
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It).** Don't build for hypothetical future requirements. Add code, parameters, configuration, and abstraction *when* you need it, not because you might need it later. Generality has a real cost in readability and maintenance; specificity is cheaper. If a future use case actually arrives, the refactor will be obvious. If it doesn't arrive, the speculative code is just clutter.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple).** Prefer the most direct solution that works. Clever code is harder to debug at 2am. If you find yourself reaching for a metaprogramming trick, an inheritance hierarchy, or a custom DSL, ask whether plain functions or straight-through data flow would do.
- **Idiomatic patterns.** Follow the conventions of the language and ecosystem you're working in: Ruby idioms in Ruby (RuboCop, Sorbet conventions, `do...end` for multi-line blocks), Bash idioms in Bash (`set -euo pipefail`, POSIX where portability matters), Objective-C idioms in ObjC (ARC, ivar prefix `_`, NSError** out-params), and so on. Don't transplant patterns from one language to another. The best style for a project is the one its existing files already use.
- **Comments minimum.** Self-documenting names beat explanatory comments. Code that needs a comment to explain *what* it does usually wants to be rewritten; code that needs a comment to explain *why* it does it that way (non-obvious tradeoff, link to bug or RFC, "this looks wrong but isn't because...") is fine. Inline first-person (`we ask`, `we check`) doesn't add information; the imperative voice ("ask", "check") is enough.
- **Document public APIs and complex logic.** Distinct from comments-minimum: public interfaces deserve doc comments describing inputs, outputs, side effects, and error conditions (callers will read these). Implementation details usually don't. When a non-trivial algorithm is the right answer, leave a one-paragraph block comment explaining the approach and any references — that's not what comments-minimum prohibits.
- **Inline rule.** A new helper method or named local variable is worth introducing only when it's reused 2+ times or required by a unit test. A one-call wrapper around a clear expression is abstraction without payoff and obscures the original computation. This is the "rule of three" pattern, applied at the function/variable level rather than the larger structural level.
- **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).** A function, class, module, or script doing one thing is usually easier to understand and change than one doing many things. If a description of what it does requires "and", that's often a signal it should be split. Caveat: applied dogmatically, SRP produces a maze of tiny single-purpose units that obscure flow. The "right" granularity depends on the audience and the change-cadence of the code. Use judgment.
- **Make illegal states unrepresentable.** If a value can only be one of three things, use an enum or three named constants — not a string that could in principle be anything. State that's enforced at the type / data-structure level can't drift; state that's enforced by convention will. Most valuable for state machines (where invariants are central) and long-lived domain types; less valuable for one-shot scripts and ephemeral data.
- **Fail fast and surface errors.** Detect errors at the boundary closest to where the bad input enters. Validate user input on receipt; validate config on load; check return codes. The opposite pattern — catching errors silently and continuing with degraded state — is much harder to debug. Caveat: for internal helpers whose callers can sensibly recover, returning a typed result (success/error pair) is sometimes cleaner than throwing.
- **Tests for new functionality.** Match the project's existing testing pattern. Some projects use unit tests, some use integration tests, some rely on a manual testing checklist (per AGENTS.md). If a project has tests, new functionality gets tests. If introducing a new testing approach (e.g., adding RSpec to a project that previously had no Ruby tests), surface that as a separate proposal rather than slipping it into a feature commit.
- **Suggest `docs/` updates when appropriate.** When a feature changes user-visible behavior, a public API, an installation procedure, or a developer workflow, propose corresponding documentation updates as part of the same change. Don't ship a feature whose users can't discover how to use it.

These principles are mutual constraints, not independent rules. DRY taken to extremes produces over-abstraction (violating KISS). YAGNI taken to extremes produces fragile code that breaks on the next minor extension. SRP taken to extremes produces a maze of tiny methods. The agent should hold all of them and pick the one that applies most strongly to the situation.

## Citing external code

When using code, configuration, or technique borrowed from a public discussion forum (Stack Exchange, Hacker News, Reddit, blog posts, GitHub Gists, mailing-list archives, etc.):

1. **Surface the source URL** in the proposal. The maintainer should be able to follow the link.
2. **Briefly evaluate why the code is correct or applicable** — not a full audit, but a one-line "this matches the use case because X" or "the answer is from Y who is a recognized authority on Z."
3. **Wait for approval** before applying.

Forum code is unsigned by definition. It can be wrong, outdated, malicious, or correct-for-a-different-context. The agent's training discourages blind copy-paste, but the structural defense is to make the source explicit. The maintainer's quick read of the link is the review step.

This applies even to code the agent writes "from scratch" if it relied on a forum-sourced approach to inform the structure. If the algorithm came from Stack Overflow, say so.

## Errors are evidence, not obstacles

When a command fails, the first response is to read the error carefully, not retry with a workaround. Surprising errors usually reveal something important about the system; the right response is "interesting — let me think about what this means," not "let me try the next variant."

When a sandbox or permission block surfaces, before proposing a workaround, ask: is the operation that's blocked actually the right operation? Is there a narrower or more correct version of the operation that wouldn't hit the block at all? Sometimes the block is the system telling you the operation was sloppily framed.

## Fail forward to the human, not to capability inflation

If a tool call is denied, sandboxed-out, or fails for a reason that suggests escalation might fix it: stop and surface with exact command, exact error, and the minimum scope-widening that would fix it. Never propose `dangerouslyDisableSandbox`. Never `chmod -x` a hook to silence it. Only propose editing permission rules when the rule itself is incomplete or strictly wrong, not when the operation is.

`dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` is disabled by policy (`sandbox.allowUnsandboxedCommands: false` in settings). Attempting to use it is a failure mode, not a workaround.

## Accurate narration

The agent's narration about what it just did must match what actually happened. Specific traps:

- Do not describe a command as "bypassing the sandbox" unless there is direct evidence the bypass succeeded. `sh -c 'cmd'` does NOT bypass the sandbox; `sh` is sandboxed the same as `bash`. If a followup command then fails with a sandbox error, that proves the preceding command did not bypass the sandbox either.
- Do not describe a permission-denied error as the sandbox blocking, or vice versa. They look similar but the recoveries differ. Permission denial says `Bash(...)` is not allowed; sandbox denial says `Operation not permitted` or `cannot create temp file` or similar OS-level message. Identify which it is before proposing a fix.

When unsure, say so explicitly: "I'm not sure whether this failed because of the sandbox or the permission system; the error suggests X but Y is also possible — running this single test to disambiguate before proposing a fix."

## One change at a time

Changes that touch unrelated subsystems should land in separate commits, ideally separate sessions. If a session needs to fix a bug, update docs, AND test a new script — propose those as three commits and ask which to do first. Don't bundle.

## Silent state changes are forbidden

If something requires altering project configuration (`.bundle/config`, `.gitignore`, `.clang-format`, `.claude/settings.json`, etc.) to do a task, that configuration change is a separate proposal and gets its own approval. Don't slip configuration mutations into a task that's ostensibly about something else.

## Modern git CLI verbs

`git checkout` is overloaded — branch switching, file restoration, detached HEAD, and blob extraction all share one verb. Prefer the split forms introduced in git 2.23 (Aug 2019):

| Avoid                          | Use                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `git checkout <branch>`        | `git switch <branch>`                |
| `git checkout -b <branch>`     | `git switch -c <branch>`             |
| `git checkout -B <branch>`     | `git switch -C <branch>`             |
| `git checkout <commit>`        | `git switch --detach <commit>`       |
| `git checkout -- <path>`       | `git restore <path>`                 |
| `git checkout HEAD~1 <path>`   | `git restore --source=HEAD~1 <path>` |
| `git checkout --staged <path>` | `git restore --staged <path>`        |

`checkout` may still appear in `permissions.ask` for legacy compatibility, but day-to-day work uses `switch` and `restore`. They are clearer about intent and harder to misuse — `git restore --staged <path>` cannot accidentally discard a working-tree change the way `git checkout HEAD <path>` can.

## Worktrees over stash for testing

When testing a script that mutates the repo, use `git worktree add` to get an isolated working copy of the same branch rather than stashing the current work. Stashing creates a recovery risk on `pop` (especially `--include-untracked` with merge-base churn); a worktree has no such risk. The throwaway dir is removed at end of test.

Worktrees go UNDER the project tree at `worktrees/` (gitignored) because the Claude Code sandbox writable area is the project tree and its subdirectories — sibling directories are not writable.

## Park merged branches; delete only on the remote

After a branch merges, the local branch is not deleted. It is renamed into the `merged/` namespace — prefixed with the PR number that merged it — and only the remote copy is deleted:

```sh
git branch -m feature/foo merged/pr12-feature/foo
git push origin --delete feature/foo   # or GitHub's delete-on-merge
```

The `merged/*` branches are cheap rollback handles and provenance markers. They are pruned opportunistically, at the maintainer's discretion — never as part of routine cleanup an agent performs or recommends. Agent hand-off reports and cleanup checklists must say "rename to `merged/…`", not "delete the local branch"; remote deletion is unaffected.

## Long options in shell

Use long-form options for readability and grep-ability: `--extended-regexp` not `-E`, `--max-count=1` not `-n 1`, `--name-only` not whatever the short form was. Exception: when a script is in a tight loop or `xargs` chain where short options are idiomatic and the output is for human eyes (e.g., `xargs -J`).

## printf over echo; heredocs for multi-line

Prefer `printf` to `echo` in scripts and tool calls: `echo`'s handling of flags and escapes varies across shells and modes, while `printf` is POSIX-stable. `echo` remains fine for trivial static words. For multi-line strings, use a heredoc — or write the content to a file with a dedicated tool and pass the file (`--file`, `-F`, stdin) — rather than chaining `-m` arguments or embedding `\n` escapes.

## Platform: macOS and the BSD userland

These repositories target macOS end-users, and macOS ships the BSD userland, not GNU coreutils. Code — shell especially, but also anything that shells out — must run on BSD tools:

- **No GNU-only flags.** `sed -E` with multi-line address ranges, `date -d`, `find -printf`, `grep -P`, `readlink -f`, `xargs -d` and the like are unavailable on stock macOS. Use a POSIX form that works on both userlands, or a Homebrew `g`-prefixed tool (`gsed`, `gdate`) when a GNU extension is genuinely required — and say which.
- **A concrete trap:** BSD `date -j -f` needs a clean field count, and OpenSSL's `enddate` prints a double space before a single-digit day (`Jun  5 …`), so pipe through `tr -s ' '` before parsing.
- **Portable shell.** A `#!/bin/sh` script must be POSIX `sh` (macOS `/bin/sh` is bash 3.2 in POSIX mode); no `mapfile`, process substitution, `[[ ]]`, or other bash-isms. A script that needs those declares `#!/usr/bin/env bash` (or `ksh`/`zsh`) explicitly. Do not depend on Linux-only paths (`/proc`, `/sys`) or package managers (`apt`, `dpkg`).
- **Shell is linted**, dialect-aware. `sh`/`bash` scripts pass `ksh -n` (syntax; stricter than `bash -n`/`sh -n`, stock on macOS), are `shfmt`-formatted (two-space, per `.editorconfig`), and are `shellcheck`-clean at `--severity=warning` (per `.shellcheckrc`). AT&T **ksh93** scripts (a `.ksh` extension or a ksh shebang) are checked with `ksh -n` and `shellcheck --shell=ksh` but **not** `shfmt` — shfmt has no ksh93 dialect and mangles or rejects it (mvdan/sh#614). The `pre-commit.d/10-shell` plugin enforces this on staged shell and a `shell-lint` CI job on the whole tree, both through `scripts/lint-shell.sh` (ADR 0017). **Homebrew-aligned repositories are the exception:** homebrew-cask-tools and babble defer to `brew style`, which runs `shfmt` + `shellcheck` (and RuboCop) with Homebrew/brew's own config — four-space and a few other differences — carried verbatim; they do not use the two-space toobuntu config or the `10-shell` plugin.

## Plain, literal prose

Write documentation, comments, ADRs, and commit messages in plain, literal language. Name what is actually happening rather than reaching for in-group jargon or metaphor: write "repo-foundation runs the files it ships," not "repo-foundation dogfoods its config." Terms like `dogfood` or `north star` assume a shared backstory the reader may not have and obscure the plain meaning. A contributor who was not in the originating conversation should understand the sentence on first read. This is the prose counterpart to "comments minimum": fewer words, each one literal.

## Language: positivity bias

Prefer language with a positivity bias in all output — docs, prompts, summaries, commit messages, chat. Never use crime words ("steal," "stolen") or other needlessly negative words when a word with a positive connotation expresses the intended meaning just as effectively: prefer "incorporate," "adopt/adapt," "borrow," "make use of," "learn from," "prior art." This is not a request for flowery or euphemistic prose — plain and literal still governs — it is that the negative word must be *necessary* to earn its place. Reusing openly licensed work is never "stealing"; frame it as cross-pollination and adopt/adapt/skip decisions.

## Commit messages and PRs

- When a turn modifies tracked files, propose a commit decomposition for those changes before ending the turn — logical commits, each with its own ≤ 50-char subject — rather than letting uncommitted changes accumulate across turns. State it even when the work will be committed later; the decomposition is the proposal, the commit is the approval.
- Subject ≤ 50 chars; body wraps at 72; `Closes #N` in body.
- No verbose AI commentary in PR descriptions. Note AI assistance and what manual verification was performed.
- Merge commits, never squash or rebase, on PR merge (unless the project ADRs say otherwise).
- en_US spelling everywhere (`labeling` not `labelling`, `color` not `colour`).

## Agent commit + signing procedure under sandbox isolation

### Why

All repos in this project require signed commits (policy: `commit.gpgsign = true`, `gpg.format = ssh`, key under `~/.ssh`). A sandboxed agent's shell denies read access to `~/.ssh`, so any `git commit` that tries to sign **hangs** on the key/askpass step (often a macOS passphrase dialog that never returns) or fails outright. The agent therefore commits *unsigned*, and the human re-signs the batch before pushing.

### Agent: commit unsigned

```sh
ZIZMOR_OFFLINE=true GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 git commit --no-gpg-sign \
    --file /tmp/claude/msg.txt < /dev/null
```

- `--no-gpg-sign` disables signing. Do NOT add `-c commit.gpgsign=false`: it is redundant with the flag, and the string matches the `git -c commit.gpgsign=false commit *` entry in `sandbox.excludedCommands`, whose unsandboxed routing hangs the commit in the agent harness (validated 2026-07-21 — see the zizmor section below; the entry is slated for removal).
- `< /dev/null` closes stdin so nothing can block on an interactive prompt (the signing askpass, a credential helper, an editor).
- `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` stops git itself from prompting on a TTY.
- `--file` (with the message written to a sandbox-writable file first, e.g. `/tmp/claude/msg.txt`) instead of multi-line `-m` arguments: long multi-line `-m` commands are a known hang in the Claude Code harness — the call is auto-backgrounded and the commit never completes.
- Run `git commit` as its **own** standalone tool call. Chaining it in a compound command (`cmd && git commit …` or a `;`-sequence) auto-backgrounds and aborts it the same way — even `--amend --no-edit` — leaving HEAD unchanged and the file unstaged. Do any `git add` / validation in a separate call first. A single-line `-m` and `--amend --no-edit` are safe only when run standalone.
- Add `--no-verify` **only** if the pre-commit hook genuinely can't run in the sandbox (e.g. `reuse lint` without `--no-multiprocessing` aborts on the macOS Seatbelt `SC_SEM_NSEMS_MAX` syscall; `go vet ./...` / `staticcheck` can't write the module/build cache). A correctly written hook (`reuse --no-multiprocessing lint-file`, language checks gated on staged files) runs clean in-sandbox and should *not* be bypassed. The canonical `pre-commit.d` plugins are written this way — for instance the Swift plugin bypasses the on-disk cache (`swiftformat --cache ignore`, `swiftlint --no-cache`), since otherwise swiftlint exits non-zero when it cannot write `~/Library/Caches` under the sandbox. To run those tools ad hoc in a sandbox (outside the hook), pass the same flags.

### Human: re-sign the batch before pushing

```sh
git rebase --exec 'git commit --amend --no-edit --gpg-sign' origin/main
```

(`--gpg-sign` is the long form of `-S`.) What it does, and why the SHAs change:

- It walks every commit on the current branch that is **not** already in `origin/main` (the `origin/main..HEAD` range) and, for each, runs `git commit --amend --no-edit --gpg-sign` — re-committing the same tree and message, now SSH-signed. The rebase is without `--rebase-merges`, as the range is expected to be linear and preserving merge topology would add replay complexity without benefit to per-commit signing.
- The cryptographic signature is stored **inside the commit object** (alongside the tree, parents, author, and message), so signing changes the object's hash. **Every amended commit gets a new SHA**, and every descendant is rewritten too. The branch is content-equivalent but entirely new in identity.
- Safe only while the commits are unpushed (rewriting *published* history is not). The `pre-push` hook enforces the invariant from the other side — it rejects a push whose tip is unsigned (`N`) or invalidly signed — so an un-re-signed batch can't reach the remote by accident.

### Consequence: a re-signed branch diverges from a stale `main`

If you committed unsigned on `main` and then re-signed on a feature branch (or ran the rebase with `origin/main` as the base while on the branch), the "same" commits now exist at **two different SHAs**: the branch's signed ones and `main`'s old unsigned ones. Treat the **re-signed branch as the source of truth** and realign `main` to it after the branch lands (`git switch main && git reset --hard origin/main`) rather than trying to push both — `main`'s unsigned tip would be rejected anyway.

### Promoting follow-up batches from an isolated clone: cherry-pick, not merge

The same SHA-rewrite has a second consequence when the agent works in an isolated (remoteless) clone across **multiple hand-offs**. After the first promotion re-signs the batch, the clone and the live repo are patch-equivalent but SHA-divergent: from git's perspective the lineages are unrelated at every point past the first signing. A follow-up batch built in the clone sits on the *unsigned* parents, so `git merge --ff-only FETCH_HEAD` fails by construction, and a plain merge or rebase would duplicate the already-promoted commits under third SHAs.

Promote with cherry-pick and patch-id filtering instead, via `scripts/promote-from-isolated.sh [--yes] <clone-path> [<branch>]`. `--cherry-pick` compares patch-ids, not SHAs: commits already promoted (under different SHAs) are filtered out and only genuinely new work is applied, so re-running when there is nothing new is a no-op.

**The picks land unsigned — deliberately.** Unsigned status *is* the workflow state: the just-promoted batch is visually distinct (`git log --format='%h %G? %s'` shows `N`), freely amendable, and testable; `sign-push.sh` remains the single blessing step before push, exactly as for commits authored directly in the live repo, and the `pre-push` hook still rejects unsigned tips. Promotion changes only the transport, never the evaluate-then-sign workflow. The full sequence:

```sh
scripts/promote-from-isolated.sh <clone-path> <branch>  # gated, unsigned picks
# run the repo's checks; amend freely while unsigned
scripts/sign-push.sh                             # bless the batch
git push origin <branch>
```

The script refuses to apply anything until its gates pass: clean tree and correct branch; the clone side must be linear (a merge commit on the agent branch is an error, not something to pick silently); a left/right **subject collision** across the filtered delta is an error — that is the signature of a promoted copy amended in the live repo, whose patch-id no longer matches, and picking it again would conflict or duplicate; and after the `%m`-marked preview it asks for confirmation (`--yes` skips; without it, a non-TTY stdin aborts). If a pick still conflicts past the gates, the script prints recovery guidance to stderr (`--continue` after resolving, or `--abort` to return to the pre-promotion state).

Two design notes, so the boundaries are explicit rather than folklore:

- **The clone's role**: a mutable workspace **until** a commit is promoted, a frozen intent stream afterwards. Reword, split, and reorder freely before the first hand-off; once a commit's copy exists in the live repo, the live copy is the source of truth (same principle as the re-signed branch above) and fixups belong there — or in *new* clone commits. Promotion never replays clone history as such; it applies the derived patch view (`--cherry-pick` filtering is patch-id-based), which is why the clone never needs rebasing onto the signed lineage. Partial promotion, when ever needed, is a manual `git cherry-pick` of the chosen subset — the script deliberately handles only the whole-delta case.
- **The subject-collision gate is a guardrail, not an identity check.** Git cannot prove "this live commit is an amended copy of that clone commit"; matching subjects across the filtered delta is a proxy that catches the common accident. A false positive (two unrelated commits sharing a subject) blocks the script — promote that batch manually. A false negative (an amend that also reworded the subject) surfaces as a pick conflict, with recovery guidance on stderr.

Division of responsibility:

- **The human promotes.** Object-ID divergence between the clone and the live repo is expected and permanent; never "fix" it.
- **The agent keeps building on its own clone lineage** and does not chase the signed SHAs. Hand-off reports must say "promote with `scripts/promote-from-isolated.sh <clone-path> <branch>`" — never `merge --ff-only` instructions, which only hold for a first promotion. Rebasing the clone onto the signed lineage is allowed as an optional tidy-up (it empties the "<" side of the preview) but correctness never depends on it.
- **The agent must not amend clone commits that were already promoted** (that manufactures the subject-collision case); follow-ups go in new commits.

The script is covered by `spec/integration/promote_from_isolated_spec.rb` (throwaway repos under mktemp; simulates re-sign divergence, idempotence, the collision and merge gates, and the prompt guards), run by the RSpec suite in CI. `sign-push.sh` has the parallel `spec/integration/sign_push_spec.rb`.

### Pre-commit hook network tools under the sandbox (zizmor)

When a commit stages a `.github/workflows/*.yml` file, the `pre-commit` hook runs `zizmor --quiet .`. zizmor (1.25.x) builds an HTTP client at startup — even for local audits — and on macOS reads the system proxy config via `SCDynamicStoreCreate`. Under Seatbelt the `configd` mach service is unreachable, so that returns NULL and zizmor **panics** (`system-configuration … Attempted to create a NULL object`) — a crash, not a lint finding. It is **not** fixable via `sandbox.network.allowedDomains`: the panic precedes any URL contact (a bogus `ALL_PROXY` still crashes). Only running zizmor **outside** Seatbelt fixes it.

- **Validated (2026-07-21):** the two `sandbox.excludedCommands` entries behave differently. `zizmor *` **works** — a standalone `zizmor --quiet .` runs unsandboxed, no panic, in seconds. zizmor picks its mode by credential discovery: with the gh CLI logged in (the maintainer's shell) it auto-detects the token and runs online; where no credential is readable (the agent sandbox denies `~/.config/gh`) it falls back to offline mode, which is the right behavior for a lint gate anyway. The `git -c commit.gpgsign=false commit *` entry **hangs the commit** in the agent harness: an env-prefixed commit matching it stalls before git executes (reproduced 3×; the identical command without `-c commit.gpgsign=false` commits in seconds). Recommended disposition: drop the git entry (a commit gate should not depend on the network; the hook's zizmor is covered below), keep the zizmor entry for ad-hoc online audits.
- **The commit recipe:** run `git commit --no-gpg-sign …` **without** `-c commit.gpgsign=false` (the `--no-gpg-sign` flag alone disables signing; the `-c` form matches the hanging exclusion), and prepend `ZIZMOR_OFFLINE=true` (value `true`/`false`, not `1`) — the hook's zizmor runs offline and sandboxed (only online audits are suppressed; they need network and a `--gh-token` anyway), so the **full** hook still runs, no `--no-verify` or sandbox widening. Don't set it globally in `env`.

## Avoiding interactive shell hooks in tool calls

`zsh` (the typical macOS interactive shell) has hooks like `chpwd` that try to write `~/.lastpwd` on every directory change. Inside the Claude Code sandbox, those hook writes fail with "Operation not permitted" because `~/.lastpwd` is outside the writable area. This shows up as `cd:3: operation not permitted: /Users/.../lastpwd` when the agent runs `cd /path && cmd`.

The fix is NOT to widen the sandbox; it's to invoke commands without loading interactive zsh state. Two reliable patterns:

```sh
# Pattern A: use sh -c with explicit cwd (recommended).
# Inherits no zshrc; doesn't trigger chpwd hooks.
sh -c 'cd /abs/path && cmd args'

# Pattern B: invoke the command with absolute paths and no `cd`.
# Useful for commands that take their own --cwd or operate on paths
# relative to git's working tree.
git -C /abs/path status
```

Pattern A is what test infrastructure expects. Pattern B is preferred when the underlying tool supports it.

## Sandbox model

The Claude Code sandbox (Seatbelt-based on macOS) operates **below** the permission system: a command can be in `permissions.allow` and still be blocked by the sandbox if it tries to write outside the writable area or contact a non-allowlisted host.

**Default writable area**: the project directory and its subdirectories. Sibling directories are NOT writable. This includes `../<sibling>` paths.

**Common project-local additions** (in `~/.claude/settings.json` or `<repo>/.claude/settings.json`, under `sandbox.filesystem.allowWrite`):

- `/private/tmp` (canonical path of `/tmp`) — needed by shells' heredoc temp files, `mktemp`, etc.
- `/private/var/folders` and `/var/folders` — macOS's per-user `$TMPDIR` lives here. Allows `mktemp(1)`, `mkstemp(3)`, gem caches, Bundler temps.

These are standard temp-dir locations. They don't widen reach into anything sensitive — `~/.ssh`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.aws`, `~/.config/gh`, `~/Library/Keychains`, `~/.claude.json`, `~/.claude/` remain in `denyRead`.

**`make` and `launchctl`**: any `make` target that writes outside the project tree (e.g., `make install` writing to `/usr/local`, `make dev` writing to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`) goes in `sandbox.excludedCommands` so the project tree restriction is lifted for that one operation. The permission system still applies (these are usually in `permissions.ask`).

## Sandbox clones and the macOS tmp reaper

macOS deletes /tmp (/private/tmp) entries not accessed OR modified in three days: /usr/libexec/tmp_cleaner (a find over -atime/-mtime) runs daily at midnight via /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.tmp_cleaner.plist (StartCalendarInterval). A Tier 3 sandbox clone parked under /private/tmp across a multi-day session loses exactly its untouched files — including hardlinked loose git objects, since local `git clone` hardlinks the object store. The source repo loses nothing (hardlinks: the original inode survives), but the clone silently rots: worktree files vanish and `git restore` starts failing with "unable to read sha1 file". Observed on babble-w3, 2026-07-08.

Rules:

- **Prefer a non-reaped parent.** `sandbox-enter.sh` defaults `--parent` to `~/.cache/sandboxes` (created on demand; not subject to tmp_cleaner). /private/tmp remains fine for clones that live less than a day.
- **If a clone must sit in /tmp**, touch-refresh it at each session start so nothing crosses the 3-day line — e.g. `find <clone> -exec touch -a {} +` — and plan to promote and destroy within a day or two anyway.
- **Session hygiene:** at every session start in an existing clone, read `git status` critically. A wall of unexplained `D` (worktree deletions) in an untouched clone is reaper damage, not your doing: stop, salvage pending work as files/patches to /tmp/claude/, and do not trust the clone for promotes.
- Corollary the reaper gives for free: /tmp/msg-<slug>.txt commit message files are preserved for ~3 days and then self-clean.

## Bundler hygiene (Ruby projects)

A project that uses Bundler should ship `.bundle/config` with `BUNDLE_PATH: vendor/bundle` and `BUNDLE_DISABLE_SHARED_GEMS: true` so `bundle install` writes to `./vendor/bundle/` instead of the system Ruby. Without this, Bundler falls back to the active Ruby's gem dir, which on macOS is `/Library/Ruby/Gems/` — a system path the agent should never write to.

If the agent finds gems already installed system-wide before this config landed, the manual recovery is:

```sh
gem list --local | grep --extended-regexp 'rspec|<other gems>'
sudo gem uninstall <gem-list>
bundle install
```

The agent should NOT propose `sudo gem install` or any plain `gem install` on system Ruby. CI's `ruby/setup-ruby` with `bundler-cache: true` writes the same project-local layout.

## SPDX / REUSE headers

Do not hand-write SPDX headers. Run `scripts/annotate.sh`, which wraps `reuse annotate` with the project's per-filetype rules: it picks the comment style by extension, forces `.license` sidecars for generated or comment-hostile files (completions, man pages, plists, checksums), and — for Markdown with YAML frontmatter — places the SPDX block as `#` comments *inside* the frontmatter, so the frontmatter stays at file position 1 and tools that parse it (`adrs doctor`, Claude Code skill loaders) keep working. A hand-placed header drifts from that output and often lands in the wrong position. The pre-commit hook and CI's `lint-reuse` job reject files missing SPDX, so run `annotate.sh` after creating any file; it only touches files `reuse lint` reports as non-compliant.

This **includes Architectural Decision Records** (the MADR-format files under `docs/decisions/`). They are exactly the YAML-frontmatter case above: `reuse annotate --style=html` (what `annotate.sh` runs for `.md`) inserts the SPDX block as `#` comment lines at the top *inside* the `---` fence, above `number:`/`title:` — the same form every existing ADR carries, and the form `adrs doctor` requires. So write an ADR body with no SPDX and let `annotate.sh` add it; never hand-write or hand-place the SPDX block in an ADR (or paste it above the frontmatter, which breaks `adrs doctor`).

## Architecture decision records

ADRs are MADR 4.0, authored and linted with `adrs` (homebrew/core: `brew install adrs`); each repo carries the synced `adrs.toml`. Org-wide ADRs live only in repo-foundation and are referenced by pointer; a repo's own ADRs start at its own 0001 (repo-foundation ADR 0004). `adrs doctor` is the health gate: the `50-adrs` pre-commit plugin runs it when `docs/decisions/**` or `adrs.toml` is staged, and the `lint-adrs` job in the synced `lint.yml` is the CI backstop. Doctor errors block; warnings (placeholder text, style) do not.

Frontmatter house style: `number`, `title`, `status`, `date`, `decision-makers`, with `status` lowercase by convention — the tool is case-insensitive and only warns on unknown status values. Use the MADR section names doctor expects: `## Context and Problem Statement`, `## Decision Outcome`, and `### Consequences` under Decision Outcome. SPDX goes inside the YAML frontmatter via `scripts/annotate.sh` (see the SPDX / REUSE section above). For AI-assisted authoring, the `adrs` MCP server (`adrs mcp serve`) is configured per repo in `.mcp.json` — the server set in that file is a per-repo concern, so it is not synced.

## Universal tools available without prompt

These macOS dev tools are commonly allowlisted in Claude Code settings. The agent does not need to ask before running them:

- File and binary inspection: `file`, `otool`, `nm`, `dyld_info`, `codesign --verify/--display`, `plutil -lint/-p`, `lipo -info/-archs`
- Process and memory: `vmmap`, `sample`, `spindump`
- System information: `sw_vers`, `uname`, `sysctl -n`, `defaults read`, `defaults domains`
- Logging: `log show`, `log stream`
- Power: `pmset -g` (READ ONLY — never the mutating forms)
- IORegistry: `ioreg`, `system_profiler`
- launchd: `launchctl list`, `launchctl print`
- Apple SDK paths: `xcrun --find`, `xcrun --show-sdk-path`, `xcrun --show-sdk-version`
- Lint: `actionlint`, `zizmor`, `shellcheck`, `shfmt --diff`, `clang-format --style=file --dry-run`, `clang-tidy`, `reuse lint`, `reuse lint-file` (read-only forms), `pinact run --check`, `pinact run --verify`
- git: `status`, `log`, `diff`, `show`, `rev-parse`, `ls-files`, `ls-tree`, `config --get`, `remote -v/get-url`, `branch` / `--show-current`/`--list`/`-a`, `tag`/`--list`, `fetch`, `worktree list`
- gh (read-only): `pr view/list/checks/diff`, `issue view/list`, `repo view`, `run view/list`, `release list/view`, `api -X GET ...`, `auth status`
- Web: `WebSearch`, `WebFetch` (these are first-class Claude Code tools, separate from Bash; the network sandbox allowlist is the actual gate).

## Tools that require approval

These mutate state. The agent should propose the exact command and wait for approval:

- git (mutating): `add`, `commit`, `tag -a`/`-d`, `switch`/`checkout`, `stash`, `restore`, `reset --soft`/`--mixed`/`HEAD`, `rm`, `mv`, `rebase`, `cherry-pick`, `revert`, `merge`, `pull`, `branch -d`/`-m`, `worktree add`/`remove`/`prune`
- launchctl: `bootstrap`, `bootout`, `kickstart`, `enable`, `disable`
- gh (mutating, careful): `pr comment`/`edit`/`create`/`review`/ `ready`, `issue comment`/`create`/`edit`, `release create`
- Code mutation: `clang-format -i`, `reuse annotate`, `pinact run` (without `--check`/`--verify`)
- Network: `curl` (any method other than GET semantics)
- Tooling: `bundle install` (asks even with project `.bundle/config`, defense in depth)

## Universally denied operations

These are blanket-denied. Don't propose workarounds:

- Force operations: `git push --force`, `git push --force-with-lease`, `git reset --hard`, `git branch -D`, `git clean`, `git filter-branch`, `git filter-repo`, `git update-ref`, `git replace`, `git reflog expire/delete`, `git gc --prune`, `git tag -f`/`--force`
- Pushes: `git push` (any form). The maintainer pushes manually after reviewing local commits.
- Remote mutations: `git remote add/remove/rm/rename/set-url`, `git config --global`, `git config --unset/--unset-all/--remove-section`
- gh destructive: `pr merge/close/delete`, `repo delete/archive/edit`, `release delete/upload`, `secret set/delete`, `ruleset delete`, `api -X DELETE/PUT/POST/PATCH`, `auth login/logout/refresh`
- Filesystem destructive: `rm -rf` (any form), `rm -rf .` / `/` / `~` / `$HOME`, `rm -rf ..` / `../` / `../<anything>` (path traversal)
- Privilege escalation: `sudo` (any form)
- System mutation: `nvram`, `csrutil`, `kmutil`, `kextload`/`kextunload`, `dscl . -create/-delete/-change/-append`, `dseditgroup`, `pwpolicy`, `spctl --master-disable`, `xattr -d/-dr com.apple.quarantine`
- launchd destructive: `launchctl reboot`, `launchctl unload`, `launchctl bootstrap system/`, `launchctl bootout system/`
- Power state: `pmset -a/-b/-c/-u`, `pmset schedule/repeat`, `pmset sleepnow`, `pmset displaysleepnow`
- Defaults mutation: `defaults write`, `defaults delete`
- Logs erase: `log erase`
- Disk mutation: `diskutil eraseDisk/eraseVolume/reformat/unmount/unmountDisk`, `asr`
- System control: `shutdown`, `reboot`, `halt`
- Kill: `killall -9` (use `kill -TERM` if a process needs stopping and surface to the maintainer first)
- System package managers: `brew install/uninstall/upgrade/cleanup/autoremove`, `npm install/uninstall/exec`, `npx`, `pip install/uninstall`, `pip3 install/uninstall`, `gem install/uninstall`, `cargo install`, `go install`
- Curl-pipe-shell variants: `curl ... | sh|bash|zsh|...`, `curl -X DELETE/PUT/POST/PATCH`
- Network egress that bypasses the allowlist: `wget`, `ssh`, `scp`, `rsync`
- Reading secrets: `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.config/gh`, `~/Library/Keychains`, `~/.claude.json`, `~/.claude/`, `~/.netrc`, `~/.pgpass`, `./.env*`

## Confirm policy intent before coding

When a change touches a policy or a design decision — a hook's gating rule, a CI check, ADR-governed behavior — state the *intended policy* in plain terms and confirm it before writing code. Review-bot comments (CodeRabbit, Copilot, and the like) and an agent's own "this looks more correct / stricter" instinct are **inputs to weigh, not directives to apply**: bots optimize for plausible-looking gating, not for what the maintainer is actually trying to enforce, so applying them uncritically produces a technically-defensible but wrong policy that costs more to unwind than it would have to prevent. Read the canonical source first (often the most complete sibling repo plus its CONTRIBUTING and ADRs), restate the policy, and get agreement before implementing. This is a specific case of "one change at a time" and "errors are evidence": a surprising review suggestion is something to understand, not a task to execute.

This extends to **design decisions**, not only policy gates. When a choice is contested, recurring, or genuinely the maintainer's to make (it affects their workflow, tooling, or cost), state a clear recommendation with reasoning and confirm the intended approach before a large refactor — do not implement, revert, and re-implement through several variants. A reference implementation (a sibling repo, an upstream project) is an input to analyze and learn from, not a canonical to copy verbatim; say which approach you chose and why. And when the maintainer asks for an honest assessment, give it plainly even when it pushes back on their stated directive — a reasoned dissent, recorded in an ADR when the decision warrants, is more useful than silent compliance.

## Preserve the user's work-in-progress before agent edits

When agent edits would mix with the user's uncommitted working-tree changes, commit or otherwise preserve the user's WIP **first** — decomposed into logical, per-concern commits — then commit the agent's edits separately. Re-survey `git status` and attribute each changed file to WIP vs. agent edit (diff to confirm) before committing. Prefer decomposing in place over worktree-and-revert gymnastics, which are brittle and easy to get wrong. For a file that mixes both concerns, split the hunks non-interactively — `git apply --cached` on a sliced patch (`git add -p` is unavailable in the sandbox). Add the `Co-Authored-By` trailer only to commits that are genuinely the agent's authored change, never to the user's WIP commits.

## Cross-repo references in committed docs

When a committed, contributor-visible doc references a **different** repo (a sibling, or any repo other than the one the doc lives in), use the GitHub `<org>/<repo>` slug — e.g. `toobuntu/babble` — not a bare repo name (ambiguous) and not an absolute path like `~/devel/claude/desktop/babble` (which leaks the maintainer's machine layout and breaks when directories move). A doc's reference to its **own** repo root uses the `<repo-root>` placeholder instead. Make every reference to the same repo uniform, including pre-existing prose mentions.

## Session economy

Every prompt sent to Claude Code consumes tokens. The biggest token multipliers are:

- AGENTS.md size (read on every session start) — keep terse; move long reference material to `docs/<topic>.md` files that AGENTS.md only links to.
- Long conversations (history accumulates) — use `/clear` between unrelated tasks.
- File reads (each adds to context) — read targeted ranges with `view_range` when only part of a file is needed.

`permissions.allow`/`ask`/`deny` entries do NOT consume tokens beyond the user's click on a permission prompt. The number of entries doesn't scale token consumption. Optimize AGENTS.md size, not permission entry count.
