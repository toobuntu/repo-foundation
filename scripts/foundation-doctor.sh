# foundation-doctor.sh — flag per-repo scaffold workflows that have gone stale.
#
# The ci / codeql / copilot-setup-steps workflows are copy-once scaffolds owned
# per repo (ADR 0015), so the sync cannot realign them and there is no clean
# canonical to diff them against. This is an age-based nudge instead: a scaffold
# untouched for longer than the threshold is reported for manual reconciliation
# against current upstream guidance. The scheduled scaffold-drift.yml workflow
# runs the same check and opens an issue — one implementation, two triggers.
#
# A scaffold that carries the "do not modify it directly" sync header is skipped:
# it is a synced canonical file (a Homebrew tap's copilot-setup-steps), not a
# per-repo scaffold, and it self-heals through the sync.
#
# Usage: scripts/foundation-doctor.sh [--max-age-days N] [repo-root]
#   FOUNDATION_DOCTOR_MAX_AGE_DAYS overrides the default (365). Exits non-zero
#   if any scaffold is stale, so a caller (CI) can act on it.
